            Benchmark results from GitHub Actions

            Lower numbers are good, higher numbers are bad. A ratio less than 1
            means a speed up and greater than 1 means a slowdown. Green lines
            beginning with `+` are slowdowns (the PR is slower then master or
            master is slower than the previous release). Red lines beginning
            with `-` are speedups.

            Significantly changed benchmark results (PR vs main)
            ```diff
            ${{ steps.pr_vs_master_changed.outputs.content }}
            ```
            Full benchmark results can be found as artifacts in GitHub Actions
            (click on checks at the top of the PR).
