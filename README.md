The SASKTRAN radiative transfer framework is a radiative transfer tool developed at the University of Saskatchewan. Originally designed for use with the OSIRIS instrument (https://research-groups.usask.ca/osiris/) it has since evolved to be applicable to a large variety of applications. SASKTRAN is a full framework and not just a radiative transfer model, as such it contains databases or interfaces to standard climatologies and species optical properties.

SASKTRAN2 is a full re-implementation of the original SASKTRAN framework with large computational efficiency
improvements, full linearizations of atmospheric input properties, and an improved Python interface.

## Installation
The preferred method to install SASKTRAN2 is through the pre-compiled Conda package

```
conda install -c usask-arg -c conda-forge sasktran2
```
these packages are made available for Python versions 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 on Windows/Linux/Mac platforms.
For Mac, both x86_64 and Arm packages are available.

Wheels are also built for the same platforms and can be installed through,
```
pip install sasktran2
```

SASKTRAN2 can also be built directly from source,
```
pip install .
```

When building from source it is required that a Blas/LAPACK implementation is findable by CMake.

We also provide an example `conda` environment that can be used to build the code.  For Mac/Linux
we recommend,

```
conda env create -f conda/dev_env.yml
```

For Windows you need to first install Visual Studio 2022, and then
```
conda env create -f conda/dev_env_windows.yml
```

Then the package can be installed with.
```
conda activate sasktran2-dev-env
pip install .
```
