The SASKTRAN Radiative Transfer Framework (Version 2)

:::

::::

SASKTRAN2 is an atmospheric radiative transfer model developed at the University of Saskatchewan. It is a full rewrite of the original [SASKTRAN Model](https://github.com/usask-arg/sasktran)
providing

 - A simpler, more powerful, user interface
 - Full capability to calculate weighting functions, i.e. derivatives of output radiative quantities with respect to input atmospheric properties
 - Greatly improved efficiency for hyperspectral calculations

SASKTRAN2 is still in active development, and things are subject to change quickly, however it is already usable for many applications.
After [Installing](_installation) the model, we recommend starting with the [Quick Start Guide](_quickstart) to get a feel for the core concepts of the interface.
